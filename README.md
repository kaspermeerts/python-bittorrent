# Python Bittorrent client

This is a proof of concept Bittorrent client. It's not meant for or capable of normal usage, but it served as a good exercise for myself to learn about how Bittorrent works and how to parse a network protocol.

Moreover, I kept defensive programming and separation of responsibilities in mind when designing the various components.
